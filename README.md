Resume Data Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extracting names, skills, education, and experience

Keyword Extraction & Job Matching – Identifying key skills and matching job descriptions

Resume Scoring & Ranking – Assigning scores based on relevance

Data Visualization & Insights – Graphical representation of key resume trends

🛠 Technologies Used
Python, pandas, numpy

spaCy, NLTK, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
